I am going to discuss the ethics of recommender systems using the framework of utilitarianism. Like with all frameworks,  one can come to multiple conclusions depending on what is taken into consideration. That being said, I do not think this is the only conclusion you can come to using utilitarian framework, nor that it is the best analysis. 

Utilitarianism can be equated to the phrase, "the ends justify the means.". It is important that we consider not just the objective as the "end", but also the unintended or obscure affects that the "means" create. Let us start with the obvious. The objective "ends" of recommender systems are that they curate music that you are likely to enjoy and provide ad choices that are more likely to result in a purchase. You are able to choose if you respond to the ad, so there isn't any inherent bad to having these ads displayed to you. The "means" to this end is collecting, storing, and analyzing personal and behavioral data. Now, let us look at the less obvious impact of these means. Other companies will have to develop similar algorithms to remain competitive to consumers and advertisers. This drives an economy of personal data, which incentivizes unethical capture and sharing of consumer data.
