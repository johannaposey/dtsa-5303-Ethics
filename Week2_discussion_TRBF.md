Being a very private person, I used to think that the USA should have a Right to be Forgotten. However, after learning more about the EU legislation, I have changed my opinion. Because the internet is global, I do not think it is feasible to have a RtbF in one country or region and not in others. If someone in the EU wanted to find information that has been removed from their country's Google results, it is very easy for them to search using a different Google url and find the results they are looking for. As more and more results are removed this will become more and more common place. 

My basis for this decision is not founded in ethics, but rather in practicality. First, I would like to point out that not all speech is protected under the First Amendment. Defamation and copyright violations are examples of speech that is not protected. If someone were to spread lies about you, or post images they have stolen from you, there already exists legal processes for having this data removed from the internet. processes for having this data removed from the internet. Moreover, these routes don't require companies like Google to make the judgment of if something should be removed. Second, I'd like to describe a scenario that could occur based on an example from one of the articles. There was a post about a public official that was removed from searches even though the subject was not a private individual. It was stated that the reason the post was removed is that a commentor on the post requested it be removed. This loophole could lead to public officials hiring people to leave comments on negative posts about themselves and requesting the link be removed after the appropriate amount of time making it possible for them to burry information that otherwise would have had a negative impact on the publics' perception of them.
